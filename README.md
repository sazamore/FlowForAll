# FlowForAll
Open source patterns for practice fans

## Notifications
Each fan is described with a pattern, grip style (Tech, Russian) and whether or not it a test cut has been made (tested/untested). If you try an untested pattern, please feel free to add suggestions using the Pull Request feature (fast), or email the owner of this account (slow).
You are creating your practice toys **at your own risk**. Any injury sustained in the making or use of the product is at your risk and not the liability of the designer(s) or owner of this repository. By downloading, using or sharing these materials, you understand that any damage to the material, machinery or physical body is at your own risk.

## How to make practice fans
These templates arer designed for use with a laser cutter. The files contain a vector image of a fan pattern with black (0,0,0) lines at 0.01 pixel width. All fans will be etched with the #FlowForAll emblem. Please do not remove the emblem, as it is a mark of participants in the movement for inclusion within the flow community.

Open the file in the recommended program for your laser cutter. Ensure that the file or artboard size is the same as the material you are going to cut. The standard size for documents/artboards is 36" x 24" (91cm x 61cm). Ensure that the laser cutter settings are set to cut through the material. Color mapping is not required.

Laser cutters vary! Please use settings for your specific material as recommended in the manual for a given laser cutters.

## Where to find a laser cutter
Your local maker space likely has laser cutters available for public use, after training. For a list of maker spaces (2020) please check out [this link.](https://www.nexpcb.com/blog/the-list-of-makerspaces).

Many state and public universities and colleges will have maker spaces or tools available for public or affiliate use. Search your nearby state university for outreach events and facilities that may have a laser cutter. Ask your peers who attend or work at universities for access!

## Recommended materials
I strongly recommend using materials at or around 1/4 in (6 mm) in width. This is a decent size for gripping.
For practice fans, I have found that **Birch plywood** has a fine grain, which results in smooth edges and lasting strength.
**Acrylic** is another suitable material for practice toys, but can be pricey and hard to source. Maker spaces may have materials or material ordering options. Please test with less expensive material, especially if a file is untested.

## Finishing
All laser cuts should be sanded thoroughly before use to boost longevity and minimize injury.
Wooden products should be sealed for longevity. Spray polyurethane is an accessible and affordable way to quickly seal your practice toys.
